## DESCRIPTION:
Transmorgify is a web app experimenting with various APIs. Transmorgify will first take a user input of a url of an image. Once the input is received Microsoft Computer Vision OCR API will return the text extracted from the image. The app will than allow the user to translate the text into one of the provided languages using Google Translate API. The user can also convert that text into an American English audio recording* via IBM Watson Text-to-Speech API. The final kicker feature is the user input for an email address where the user can choose an email to send the translated text and audio recording file.

*TODO Implementation:
1. Dropdown menu to allow the user to choose from various languages (besides American English) to convert into an audio file.

Built by Joshua Maddox and John Son.

Deployed on Heroku [here](https://warm-river-73199.herokuapp.com/).

Latest Release: November 20rd, 2016.
