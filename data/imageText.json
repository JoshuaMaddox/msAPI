"Designing with Text If message is a part of interactive project or website where user is seeking information , great deal of text can be packed on the screen. — Too little text on the screen requires annoying page turns and unnecessary mouse clicks and waits. — Too much text can make the screen seem overcrowded and unpleasant. If the message is presentation slides for public speaking — Use bulleted points on large fonts and few words with lots of white space — audience should focus on the speaker rather than reading the slides."
